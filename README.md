#  IntELiMon Model Building

This repository is a template for building and validating a predictive regression model from point-cloud–derived metrics: it selects a small, informative subset of variables, fits a linear model to a target field measurement (e.g., woody cover), and checks performance and assumptions. It then generates train/test comparison plots, computes error metrics, and saves the trained model to disk.
